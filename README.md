# Password Verification Kata

**Using TDD**, create a class that verifies whether a given password is valid or not.

Possible conditions to verify:
1. at least 8 characters
2. at least one UPPERCASE letter
3. at least one lowercase letter
4. at least one number
5. at least one of these special characters: !@#$%^&*()_+= 

A password is considered valid if at least three of the previous conditions are met.

A password is never valid if the first condition is not met.
